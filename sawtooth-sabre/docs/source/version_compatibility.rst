****************************************
Sabre and Sawtooth Version Compatibility
****************************************

The following table shows the compatible versions of the Sabre transaction
processor, Sabre SDK, and Sawtooth Rust SDK. It also shows the Docker tag for
the Sabre transaction processor image.

 - The Sabre transaction processor versions are
   the versions used as part of the transaction processorâ€™s registration.

 - The Sabre SDK versions are the Crate versions of the Rust library that should
   be set in the Cargo.toml file.

 - The Docker tag is the tag that should be used for the
   hyperledger/sawtooth-sabre-tp image if including in a docker-compose yaml
   file.

 - The Sawtooth Rust SDK versions are the Crate versions of the Rust library
   that should be set in the Cargo.toml file.
