Pike Transaction Family Specification
*****************************************

Overview
=========

The Pike Transaction Family is designed to track the identities of the
actors involved in the supply chain. These actors are agents and the
organizations they represent. The roles that the agents play within said
organizations are also tracked. This information can be used to determine who
is allowed to interact with a platform, and to what extent they are allowed
to interact with the platform.

State
=====

Agent
-----

An agent is a cryptographic public key which has a relationship, defined by
roles, with an organization.  The list of roles can be used by transaction
processors for permissioning or in combination with Smart Permissions.

An agent has five fields:

- public_key: An agentâ€™s cryptographic public key. Only one agent can belong to
  the public key.
- org_id: The identifier of the organization to which the agent belongs.
- active: Whether the agent is currently considered active at the organization.
- roles: A list of roles the agent has with the organization.
- metadata: A list of key value pairs describing organization specific data
  about the agent.

The public_key is the unique key for an Agent.

.. code-block:: protobuf

    message Agent {
        string org_id = 1;
        string public_key = 2;
        bool active = 3;
        repeated string roles = 4;
        repeated KeyValueEntry metadata = 5;
    }

    message KeyValueEntry {
      string key = 1;
      string value = 2;
    }

Agent List
----------

Agents whose addresses collide are stored in an agent list. An agent list
contains one field:

- agents: a list of agents

.. code-block:: protobuf

    message AgentList {
        repeated Agent agents = 1;
    }

Organization
------------

An organization has three fields:

- id: a unique identifier for the organization
- name: a user defined identifier for the organization
- address: a physical address for the organization

The id is the unique key for an Organization.

.. code-block:: protobuf

    message Organization {
        string org_id = 1;
        string name = 2;
        string address = 3;
    }

Organization List
-----------------

Organizations whose addresses collide are stored in an organization list. An
organization list contains one field:

- organizations: a list of organization


.. code-block:: protobuf

    message OrganizationList {
        repeated Organization organizations = 1;
    }

Addressing
----------

Agent State
^^^^^^^^^^^

The specific namespace prefix within Pike for Agent State is cad11d00,
which is the general Pike namespace cad11d concatenated with 00. The
remaining 62 characters are made of the first 62 character of the hash of the
agent's public key.

Organization State
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The specific namespace prefix within Pike for Organization State is
cad11d01, which is the general Pike namespace cad11d concatenated with 01.
The remaining 62 characters are made of the first 62 character of the hash of
the organization's id.

Transaction Payload
===================

Pike transaction family payloads are defined by the following protocol
buffers code:

.. code-block:: protobuf

    message PikePayload {
        enum Action {
            ACTION_UNSET = 0;

            CREATE_AGENT = 1;
            UPDATE_AGENT = 2;

            CREATE_ORGANIZATION = 4;
            UPDATE_ORGANIZATION = 5;
        }

        Action action = 1;

        CreateAgentAction create_agent = 2;
        UpdateAgentAction update_agent = 3;

        CreateOrganizationAction create_org = 4;
        UpdateOrganizationAction update_org = 5;
    }

Transaction Header
==================

Inputs and Outputs
------------------

The inputs for Pike family transactions must include:

- The address of the agent or organization being modified
- The address of the admin agent (agent correlating to the signing key)

The outputs for Pike family transactions must include:

- The address of the agent or organization being modified
- If creating an organization, the address of the agent that will be created as
  admin


Dependencies
------------

None

Family
------

- family_name: "pike"
- family_version: "0.1"

Execution
=========

One of the following actions is performed while applying the transaction:

CREATE_AGENT
    This operation adds a new agent into Global State. Only another agent that
    holds an admin role for the included organization may create an agent.

    .. code-block:: protobuf

      message CreateAgentAction {
          string org_id = 1;
          string public_key = 2;
          bool active = 3;
          repeated string roles = 4;
          repeated KeyValueEntry metadata = 5;
        }

UPDATE_AGENT
    This operation updates the roles, metadata, and active status of an
    existing agent stored in Global State. Only another agent that holds an
    admin role for the included organization may update an agent.

    .. code-block:: protobuf

        message UpdateAgentAction {
          string org_id = 1;
          string public_key = 2;
          string active = 3;
          repeated string roles = 4;
          repeated KeyValueEntry metadata = 5;
        }

CREATE_ORGANIZATION
    This operation adds a new organization to the Global State. The id for each
    organization must be unique and cannot be changed once the organization is
    created. The public key used to sign the transaction will
    automatically be added as an new agent with the admin role.

    .. code-block:: protobuf

      message CreateOrganizationAction {
        string id = 1;
        string name = 2;
        string address = 3;
      }

UPDATE_ORGANIZATION
    This operation updates the name and address of an existing organization
    stored in Global State. Only an agent that holds an admin role for the
    included organization may update the organization.

    .. code-block:: protobuf

      message UpdateOrganizationAction {
        string id = 1;
        string name = 2;
        string address = 3;
      }
